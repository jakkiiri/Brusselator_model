MAT292 Final Project: Exploring different numerical methods and Neural Networks to Solving the Brusselator Model ODE

Project has been deployed on Streamlit App. Access the Project online with the following URL:
brusselator.streamlit.app

It may take a while for the Streamlit app to load. You may have to "wake it up." Please be patient :)

Different features of the code base (PINN, Euler's Method, and RK4) are on different branches. Since an attempt to merge the code into main was not made, please switch to those branches if you want to view the code. The GUI branch is also available.
