This branch implements a simple gui in streamlit used to aid in timing and computation analysis of the four proposed methods of solving the Brusselator ODE.

To access the GUI on the Streamlit APP online, please access the following URL:
brusselator.streamlit.app
It may take a while for the Streamlit APP to load, please be patient.

1. Create the Venv: python3 -m venv venv
2. Activate the Venv: ./venv/Scripts/Activate
3. Install Dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
